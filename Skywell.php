      <h3>What is Skywell?</h3>
      <p>Simply it makes water from the air.<br> No plumbing needed only power. Meaning that it can be wheeled to where it needs to be and left, no having to get a plumber in to run water pipes to it.</p>
      <h3>Surely it doesn't generate enough for an office?</h3>
      <p>While Skywell may not provide enough fresh water to satisfy a large office full of heavy drinkers, it does supply up to 18 litres of fresh water per day, enough to quench the thirst of 10 average usage office staff.</p>
      <p>As well as generating the water, it will also heat or chill the water on demand, so if you want kettle temperature water or water like it's been sat in the fridge all day you can. It can supply from 3&#176;C to around 98&#176;C, which is more than enough for a hot cup of tea or a refreshing drink.</p>
