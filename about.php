			<h1>The Traditional Model. . . . . .</h1>

				<img alt="" src="images/about1.jpg" title="" /> </div>
			<div class="left" style="width: 550px">
				<p>There are two major changes to the traditional model that
				require end users to re-evaluate their dealer selection criteria.
				These changes are corporate downsizing and extremely rapid advances
				in technology and products. Every major manufacturer has reduced
				their employee count; technical sales and support have been
				extremely hard hit. Manufacturers are trying to do more with
				less. Meanwhile, end users demands and needs are increasing.
				This presents a unique position for the proactive dealer. First,
				the dealer must be small enough to quickly adapt new technology.
				Second, the dealer must be large enough (well financed) to maintain
				both quality support and research staff.</p>

				<p>All dealers generally succeed in the traditional model (i.e.
				they all know how to deliver products at a discounted price).
				ParkWood Document Solutions Ltd. does not believe we will earn
				your business over these issues since all dealers operate essentially
				the same. We do believe however, that you will stay or move
				to a dealer who performs far ahead of the field in both technological
				vision and tactical support. A dealer who understands that customer
				support is paramount, supplying the correct equipment at the
				right price from the very outset is essential and that listening
				and responding to the changing needs of each individual client
				will ensure a long standing and harmonious relationship for
				all parties. Given the opportunity we will show that ParkWood&#39;s
				offerings are the best total business solutions for your company.</p>
