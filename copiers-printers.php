                                <p class="bold">Your Photocopy Requirements</p>

				<p>An MFP is an office machine which incorporates the functionality
				of multiple devices in one, so as to have a smaller footprint in
				a home or small business setting, or to provide centralized document
				management/distribution/production in a large-office setting. A
				typical MFP may act as a combination of some or all of the following
				devices: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Printer</li>
					<li>Scanner</li>
					<li>Photocopier</li>
					<li>Fax</li>
					<li>E-mail</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The range of options is vast when it comes to choosing a photocopier
				for your office. For starters, there is an extremely large number
				of actual photocopiers on the market to choose from, all of which
				have different speeds, functions and prices. Then there is the manner
				in which you purchase it; either buying it outright, leasing or
				renting. And finally, you will need to consider the maintenance
				and service arrangements to deal with the inevitable hiccups that
				will occur during its operational life. We can supply a service
				contact with all our devices</p>
				<p>Assessing our customers needs is the key to choosing the right
				photocopier. As the volume and type of copies you need to make will
				ultimately determine the machine best suited to your office.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How many copies will you need to make on a monthly basis?</li>
					<li>Will you need both colour and black and white copies?</li>
					<li>What size copies will you need to make and on what sort
					of paper would you like them?</li>
					<li>Will you need additional functions such as image editing
					or double sided printing?</li>
					<li>Will you expect your photocopier to also act as a scanner
					or fax machine?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Having answered the questions above, we will be better equipped
				to determine which photocopier is most suited to you. One of the
				main distinguishing features or Photocopiers is size; There are
				two categories to consider:</p>
				<p class="bold">Desktop Photocopiers</p>
				<p>This term can be misleading, as although desktop photocopiers
				are smaller than their floor standing counterparts, they will normally
				take up the best part of an average desk. For small to medium sized
				businesses with a limited number of users, these can be a very reasonable
				option. Although their tray capacity, print speed and sorting options
				are often more limited than that of floor-standing photocopiers;
				at the top-end of the market desktop photocopiers offer just many
				image editing features as their larger counterparts. </p>
				<p class="bold">Floor Standing Photocopiers</p>
				<p>Most medium to large offices or those with a high demand for
				print services will find that a floor-standing photocopier is best
				suited to their needs. As the name suggests, these are larger stand-alone
				machines which, due to their size, generally have much larger tray-capacities
				and can print on larger paper formats. Being larger they can also
				offer a number of print-sorting options which are unavailable with
				smaller models and in most cases offer the highest quality resolution.</p>
