				<p>In order to function effectively all enterprises require some 
				sort of formalised system by which to store, organise, retrieve 
				and process electronic documents. While some enterprises continue 
				to rely on paper-based document management systems, it is almost 
				always easier and more reliable to use EDMS.</p>
				<p>ParkWood offer a range of Solutions and Systems, helping you 
				to keep track of your document files using a top-quality document 
				management system.</p>
				<p>The main functions of an EDMS are :-</p>
				<h3>Data Capture</h3>
				<p>Paper documents can be entered into the EDMS simply by scanning 
				them. The EDMS can also capture electronic documents sent to a user 
				via email aided by storage information provided by the user.</p>
				<h3>Document Retrieval</h3>
				<p>Individual electronic documents are assigned metadata to assist 
				in their correct filing and tracking. Metadata typically includes 
				the date of storage and the identity of the user storing it.</p>
				<p>In addition to these basic details, EDM systems attach additional 
				data to allow users to locate documents quickly using keyword searches. 
				Documents must be indexed correctly to ensure that retrieval is 
				possible.</p>
				<h3>Workflow</h3>
				<p>EDM systems enable the automatic routing of documents to the 
				user responsible for working on them. Enterprises rely on documents 
				to be processed efficiently through a step-by-step process. Unfortunately, 
				when documents are manually pushed through this process there is 
				the risk that they can be lost or overlooked.</p>
				<p>Workflow applications ensure that documents are forwarded to 
				the appropriate user automatically at specified times, alerting 
				the user of the necessity to process them. This system ensures the 
				smooth flow of documents through the enterprise.</p>
				<h3>Version Control</h3>
				<p>An integral part of the EDMS software is the ability to track 
				and manage multiple versions of the same information. In order to 
				correctly manage the ongoing development of digital data it is necessary 
				to create and correctly store multiple versions of data as it progresses 
				through the system.</p>
				<h3>Integration</h3>
				<p>In order to make best use of documents, EDM systems often standardise 
				access to other applications, enabling data to be easily transferred 
				between the EDMS and applications such as word-processors and e-mail.</p>
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>In any enterprise it is vital that the security of electronic 
				documents is appropriately managed. EDM systems ensure that access 
				to the system is restricted only to those with the correct access 
				permissions, both to ensure the integrity of data and to reduce 
				the number of documents presented to the user only to those documents 
				that are relevant to his or her role.</p>
