$faqQuestion[10] = "Can I use recycled paper in my machine?";
$faqAnswer[10] = "<p>We recommend that you do not.</p><p>Recycled paper is good for making cardboard boxes and those cup holders you find in coffee shops. It is also of a lower quality than other papeprs. Do not use it in your photocopier!</p><p>Recycled paper has to be washed, mashed, pressed and dried. Unknown to most recycled paper holds a lot more moisture and dust than normal paper. As the machine heats up after prolonged use the moisture and dust in the paper starts to come out and the paper starts to curl causing it to get stuck in the machine&#39;s workings, causing paper jams.</p><p>Saying this, most copiers will cope with up to 50% recycled paper for short print runs. </p>";
