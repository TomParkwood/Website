				<p>The paperless office is not going to happen.</p>
				<p>Paper remains the preferred way for businesses to convey information.
				And for workers who don't think your company's networked communal
				printers provide sufficient privacy and convenience, personal desktop
				printers remain their preferred way for getting ideas onto paper.
				It's a preference that wastes money, time and resources every time
				they hit the print key.</p>
				<p>Now you can reduce print waste and costs while at the same time
				providing all the printing security and convenience employees need</p>
				<p>With Print Control Software you can track, analyze, allocate
				and, if necessary, recover the costs of every document that any
				employee sends to any networked printer, copier or multi-function
				device.</p>
