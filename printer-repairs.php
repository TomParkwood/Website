				<p>Most office printers aren't cheap.<br>In most cases, a full repair can be made for a fraction of the price of a new printer.<br>
          We can repair most types of printers and mult-function devices (formally known as photocopiers).<br>
          We operate in the Hampshire region but have many contacts country wide.</p>
        <p>What you can try before you get our help.<br>
          Most print quality issues which occur in printers are cartridge problems, especially with combined toner and drum cartridges. If you can, try another cartridge or even an old one to see if it makes a difference.<br>
          If you need any help, please call us for advice. We are always happy to help. If you do call us please have the printer make and model and a descriptionof the fault, because we maybe able to cure it over the phone or point you to an easy user repair before you spend your money on a needless callout.</p>
        <p>Why would we do this?<br>
          We believe that a good service will result in you calling us again in the future. We want to show you that our interest is in your machines continued functioning and not just in our pockets.</p>
        <p>Please note that we no longer repair inkjet printers, except for high value plotters and printers, most inkjets these days are cheaper the replace than to repair.</p>
