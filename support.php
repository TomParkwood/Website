			<div class="right" style="width: 550px">
				<p>Our service response will ensure that any new copier will be
				up &amp; running on average at least 95% of the time. We will also ensure
				a 90% first time fix because our engineers will carry the right
				parts to enable them to fix your machine on their first visit 9
				times out of 10 over your contract period. With Nationwide Service
				Support provided by ParkWood Document Solutions we can maintain
				your hardware &amp; software solutions wherever your offices are located
				in the UK.</p>
				<p>A minimum call procedure is carried out at every service visit.
				This ensures that not only is copy quality checked but the machine
				is cleaned &amp; all high mortality parts are checked &amp; replaced as
				necessary, thus ensuring reliability &amp; consistent high performance
				whilst keeping downtime &amp; interruption to your business &amp; it&#39;s staff
				members to an absolute minimum.</p>
				<p>As part of our comprehensive meter based (click based) service
				contract, all consumables including toner, parts, labour &amp; preventative
				maintenance are supplied to ensure that the machines run as efficiently
				as possible throughout their lifetime. Consumables include black
				toner (unless agreed as a chargeable extra), developer &amp; drum units.
				Parts supplied for photocopiers are covered by warranty. Parts supplied
				for machines not covered by a ParkWood service contract will be
				charged at the manufacturers recommended retail price &amp; labour will
				be charged at the current rate.</p>
